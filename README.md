AirDrum (ECE362 Project)

AirDrum is a gesture-controlled percussion system that lets users “play drums in the air.” An IMU-enabled stick detects swings in real time and triggers matching drum sounds through a speaker, while a VGA display shows a simple drum kit UI with instant visual feedback

Features:

> IMU motion sensing (I²C): reads real-time accelerometer + gyroscope data

> Drum sound output (PWM): generates distinct sounds (snare, toms, hi-hats) through a speaker

> Visual feedback (VGA): displays drum icons and highlights the triggered drum on hit detection

> Volume control (ADC): potentiometer input for smooth volume adjustment
